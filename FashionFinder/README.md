# **FashionFinder: Efficient Clothing Retrieval with Deep Features and Vocabulary Trees**

We aim to build a **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** system using a **vocabulary tree** to address challenges like high computation time and storage demands in large-scale image retrieval. The vocabulary tree's hierarchical structure and efficient feature organization ensure faster and scalable retrieval.

## **Dataset**

The dataset consists of approximately **1,100 high-resolution images of garments**, covering various types, colors, and designs.  
- **Training and experimentation:** 1,000 images  
- **Categories:** Organized into distinct classes for garments and colors  
- **Dataset source:** [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)  

The methodology is divided into two phases:  
1. **Offline phase:** Model training and preparation  
2. **Online phase:** Real-time model testing and retrieval

## **Methodology**

### **Offline Phase**  
1. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Extract local features from dataset images.  
   - Incorporate extracted features into the vocabulary tree.  

2. **Tree Formation:**  
   - Cluster feature descriptors into **visual words** using clustering algorithms.  
   - Recursively partition feature space to form the vocabulary tree.  
   - Create an **inverted index** at each leaf node to record image traversal counts.

3. **Vector Representation:**  
   - Generate sparse 2D vectors of size `(number of images) Ã— (number of nodes)` to describe image traversal frequencies.  
   - Apply node weighting for efficient similarity computations.  

### **Online Phase**  
1. **Query Processing:**  
   - Extract features from the query image.  
   - Traverse the vocabulary tree to create a sparse **bag-of-words** vector.  

2. **Similarity Calculation:**  
   - Weight query vectors using pre-assigned node weights.  
   - Compare query and training image vectors using **Minkowski distance**.  
   - Optimize computations by considering non-zero nodes only.  

This efficient process ensures fast and accurate retrieval of visually similar images from the database.
