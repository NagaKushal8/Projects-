# Autism Detection with Machine Learning

This Folder contains code for a machine learning project focused on early autism detection in toddlers. The project utilizes a diverse set of machine learning models and a Kaggle dataset. Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis, data pre-processing, and model building. The evaluation metrics include ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and MCC. The project aims to contribute to pediatric healthcare by providing an effective and non-invasive tool for early autism diagnosis. Your contributions and feedback are welcome.

# Objective:
This project aims to address the critical issue of autism by establishing an early detection and intervention mechanism using advanced machine learning techniques. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention, and this research seeks to identify specific behavioral and physiological traits in toddlers as early indicators of autism.

# Significance:
Early detection can transform the lives of individuals with autism, improving their quality of life and reducing long-term impact. The project contributes to healthcare advancement by offering a precise method of diagnosing autism in toddlers, promoting early intervention and better outcomes.

# Background:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting various abilities. Early diagnosis is challenging but essential for timely intervention.

# Proposed Approach:
Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, we employ machine learning models (Naïve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to identify autism traits in toddlers. The data includes screening test results, age, gender, and health conditions.

# Implementation Steps:
Exploratory Analysis: Analyze key features using SHAP and data visualization techniques.
Pre-processing: Clean data, handle missing values, detect and treat outliers, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
Model Building: Train and evaluate machine learning models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict autism traits in toddlers.
Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluate model performance using ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to ensure robustness and reliability.
