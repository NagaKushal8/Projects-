# SMS Spam Detection with Naive Bayes

# Objective:
This project focuses on building a Naïve Bayes model for SMS spam detection using a dataset containing labeled messages as 'ham' (non-spam) or 'spam.' The primary goal is to create an effective and efficient model for identifying and filtering out spam messages from a collection of SMS.

# Dataset:
The dataset comprises SMS messages labeled as 'ham' or 'spam.' It is sourced from Kaggle and includes both the text content of the messages and their corresponding labels.

# Implementation Steps:

Evaluation Metrics:Assessed the model using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
