The concept of imperialism and the belief in the superiority of Western civilization also played a significant role in justifying colonial expansion.

Once colonized, the indigenous peoples were often ruled through a combination of direct and indirect control. Direct rule involved the imposition of colonial governments and institutions, with the colonizers holding all political and administrative power. Indirect rule, on the other hand, involved the use of local leaders and traditional structures to govern on behalf of the colonizers.

Colonized peoples were often subjected to harsh treatment, exploitation, and discrimination by the colonial powers. They were forced to provide labor, resources, and taxes to benefit the colonial economy, and their cultures, languages, and traditions were often suppressed or marginalized. Resistance to colonial rule was common, leading to uprisings, rebellions, and movements for independence.
